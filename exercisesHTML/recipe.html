<h3> Description</h3> 

<hr>
<p> This is a rich, spicy pie that slices well and has a bright pumpkin flavor. Two hints for a better result: mix the 
    filling together a day in advance to give the spices a chance to blend, and be sure to remove the pie from the oven while the 
    center is still wobbly; overcooking it will cause the filling to crack.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<hr>
<ul> 
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 cups (or one 15-ounce can) pumpkin</li>
        <li>1/4 cups light cream or evaporated milk</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Directions</h3> 
<ol>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the sugars, flour, salt, and spices.</li>
     <li>  In a large measuring cup, beat together the eggs, pumpkin, and cream or evaporated milk. Whisk into the dry ingredients. For best flavor, cover and refrigerate the filling overnight before baking.</li>
       <li> Lightly grease a 9" pie pan that's at least 1 1/2" deep. Roll the pie dough out to a 13" circle, and transfer to the pan. Crimp the edges above the rim; this will give you a little extra headroom to hold the filling when it expands in the oven. Refrigerate the crust while the oven preheats to 400Â°F.</li>
       <li> When the oven is hot, place the pie pan on a baking sheet to catch any drips. Pour the filling into the unbaked pie shell.</li>
</ol>
