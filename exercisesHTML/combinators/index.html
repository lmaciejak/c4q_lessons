    <p>Dinosaurs. Ancient people may have discovered dinosaur fossils and understandably misinterpreted them as the remains
        of dragons. Chang Qu, a Chinese historian from the 4th century B.C., mislabeled such a fossil in what is now Sichuan
        Province. Take a look at a fossilized stegosaurus, for example, and you might see why: The giant beasts averaged
        30 feet in length, were typically 14 feet tall and were covered in armored plates and spikes for defense.

    <!-- <p>The Nile Crocodile. Native to sub-Saharan Africa, Nile crocodiles may have had a more extensive range in ancient times,
        perhaps inspiring European dragon legends by swimming across the Mediterranean to Italy or Greece. They are among
        the largest of all crocodile species, with mature individuals reaching up to 18 feet in length—and unlike most others,
        they are capable of a movement called the “high walk,” in which the trunk is elevated off the ground. A giant, lumbering
        croc? Might be easy to mistake for a dragon.
    </p>
    <p>Whales. Others argue that the discovery of megafauna such as whales prompted stories of dragons. Ancient humans encountering
        whale bones would have no way of knowing that the animals were sea-based, and the idea of such gargantuan creatures
        might well have led people to assume that whales were predatory. Because live whales spend up to 90 percent of their
        time underwater, they were poorly understood for most of human history.
